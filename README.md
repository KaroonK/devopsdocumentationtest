# Welcome to DevOps Documentation Publish Example!

Hi! This is to demonstrate the auto publish for assignment 7 for our DevOps course. Below we have a short snippet of Docker vs Vagrant.

Vagrant and Docker are known tools in the DevOps world. Vagrant focuses on providing a consistent development environment, while docker is a container management tool that focuses on the code/application rather than the environment. Docker is referred as lightweight because simple containers can be started and stopped within a short period of time, unlike vms which take a bit longer. Vagrant can also use docker as a provider to automate where the flow makes sense. The biggest difference to note, however, is that Docker relies on the host operating system, while Vagrant includes the os within itself as part of the package (unless using the docker provider). Both of them have their own use-cases, but so far, docker has been my go-to because of the efficiency provided by Docker. For example, to test python scripts with different versions of python, itâ€™s very easy to start up different containers, each with a separate version of python, mounted to the current directory. I would say I would prefer Docker in this scenario, but Vagrant makes a lot more sense when collaborating with different people at once.
